>Did you know that by the time a teen in the US reaches 16 years of age, they are spending less than seven hours a week in nature, and these trends are worldwide. 
Parents are as concerned about their children not having time outdoors as they are about bullying, obesity and education. 
But they are unsure about what to do.Parents have increased concerns for their children’s safety. They are less willing to let their children play outdoors without direct supervision. 
As a result, children spend most of their free time in organized sports, music and arts activities. 
This results in less time for unstructured play than in previous generations. Richard Louv, writer and nature-time advocate, describes this condition as a “nature deficit disorder.”

<br>你是否了解在美国的一项有关于十六岁青少年的研究中，他们花费在野外的时间一周不会超过七个小时，而且这种趋势是全世界范围的。
父母们都很担心他们的孩子没有时间去户外,当他们正处于校园欺凌、身材肥胖和教育的问题中。但是他们不确定应该怎么做。
<br>父母更加关心他们孩子的安全。他们不太乐意让他们的孩子在没有直接的监督下去户外玩耍。
因此，孩子们花费他们大部分闲暇时间在有组织的运动，音乐和文艺活动上。
比之前一代人，这个结果是花费的更少时间在没有组织的玩乐上。
<br>理查德路易，他不仅是一位作家，同时也是“野外时间”的拥护者，称这个现象为”自然缺失症“。


>Digital technology is often blamed for children not going outside. Yet studies have shown little difference in the outdoor time of children who follow the American Academy of Pediatrics media guidelines and those who do not.
When done right, digital technology can be part of the solution. It can help solve the unique challenge of motivating children to go from indoors to outdoors and then to connect with nature.
<br>**Smart Toys In The Market**
<br>A growing market of toys, known as smart toys, add “intelligence” to toys through electronics or digital devices.
 Smart toys aim to provide both companionship and educational experiences. Furby, a smart toy that arrived in the 1990s, focused on companionship and free play.
 More recent examples include:
- Smart Toy Bear by Fisher Price
- Ubooly by Smart Toy LLC
- Cognitoy Dino powered by IBM Watson and created by Cognitoys

<br>数字技术经常被认为是导致孩子们不外出的主要诱因。然而研究表明那些遵循美国儿科学会指导准则的孩子和那些不遵循准则的孩子相差无几。
正常的情况下，数字技术可以成为解决办法的一部分。
它可以帮助解决这个特殊的问题，从而去鼓励孩子们从室内回归户外，进一步回归自然。
<br>**市场上的智能玩具**
<br>市场上智能玩具数量的增长，为那些应用电子或数字的设备带去了挑战。
智能玩具旨在提供陪伴和教育经验，Furby，一款在1990年出世的智能玩具，专注于友好性和自由性的玩乐。
最近的例子包括：
- Fisher Price公司生产的智能玩具熊
- 智能玩具有限公司生产的ubooly
- 由IBM Watson技术支持，Cognitoys公司创造的Cognitoy Dino

>**Bridging The Indoor, Outdoor And Nature Gap**
<br>In the US, hundreds of games and applications support children in outdoor play. Only a few of them focus on the unique challenge of transitioning children from the indoors to the outdoors and then connecting them with nature.
To address this gap, a company named Smart Toy LLC partnered with the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) to create a set of smartphone- and tablet-based activities branded with the NWF’s Ranger Rick character. 
The experience, referred to as Ranger Rick play packs, work with the Ubooly smart toy and mobile application.
The activities encourage children to first get outside and then to engage with nature. 
For example, the Nature Ninja activity prompts children to act like ninjas, sneaking across their backyards to water plants with a spray bottle.
The NWF wanted to know to what extent Ubooly and the Ranger Rick play pack were successful in achieving their goals. 
We worked with them on a study to examine the user experience of the toys.

<br>建立室内、户外和自然的联系
在美国，数以百计的游戏和应用让孩子们在户外游戏。
只有他们中的一些人专注于这个特殊的问题——鼓励孩子们从室内回归户外，进一步回归自然。
<br>为了去建立联系，一家智能玩具有限公司与国际野生协会合作去设计了系列智能手机和基于平板电脑的活动，命名为 the NWF’s Ranger Rick character。
这个活动连接到游侠里克的游戏包，和ubooly智能玩具和手机应用协同工作。这个活动鼓励孩子们首先去外面然后参与到自然中去。
例如，这个自然忍者的活动促使孩子们去表现的像忍者一样，带着水壶，偷偷的穿过家里的后院去给植物浇水。
<br>国际野生协会想要知道到什么程度的Ubooly和游侠里克游戏包是成功的实现了他们的目标。
我们在一项研究关于玩具用户体验的研究中与他们有合作。
